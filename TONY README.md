The main branch currently has the working local project, if you pull the main branch you'll be able to play with it local.
The DeploymentVersion has been edited for the deployment, not very different from local but "should" make life easier.
It has extremely basic error handling and no authentication
The Json-to-CSV folder has some things in the README, just need you to make sure you edit when deploying

The structure is as follows:
  json-to-csv has the React App
  App.js is the main file for rendering
  FilePicker.js handles the functionality of uploading and converting

  Please deploy this and if possible give me the credentials and URL, so that I can test it and make sure everything went well
  and that we dont run into weird errors when the guys starting working.
  
  I decided to not change the metadata field because i feared it might mess up in conversions later on if the format of the JSON is changed
  If you feel this is still necessary and needed, i'll obviously change it first thing in the morning and handle it.
